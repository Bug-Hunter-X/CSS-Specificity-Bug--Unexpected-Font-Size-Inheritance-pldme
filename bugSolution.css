To solve this issue, we need to be mindful of CSS specificity.  One approach is to refactor the CSS to avoid conflicts. Here's a revised version:

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
}

p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.special-paragraph {
  font-size: 14px;
}

/* Instead of targeting 'div p', use a class or ID for finer control */
.smaller-paragraph {
  font-size: 12px;
}
```

Now,  the `font-size` of paragraph elements is consistently 18px unless specifically overridden by a class like `.smaller-paragraph`. This approach improves readability and maintainability.
