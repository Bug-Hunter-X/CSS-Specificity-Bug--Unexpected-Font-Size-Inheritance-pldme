The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common issue: unexpected behavior due to inheritance and specificity.

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
}

p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.special-paragraph {
  font-size: 14px;
}

/* This selector is more specific and will override the p selector */
div p {
  font-size: 12px;
}
```

The unexpected behavior arises when a `<p>` element is nested within a `<div>`.  While `p` normally inherits `16px` from the `div` and then is overridden by its own `18px` declaration, the higher specificity of `div p` overrides this leading to a `12px` font-size.
